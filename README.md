# Projects
## A place where I place all my projects for resumes

1. Asteroids - a fun game of the player using a rocket to dodge asteroids in space! Coded in C++ with OOP principles.
2. Apples - a simple game that I created in the functional programming language Clojure! In this game, you act as a cow that seeks to devour as many spawned apples as possible!
